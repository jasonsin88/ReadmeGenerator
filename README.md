# README Generator

## Description
A GitHub repository hosts the codes of an application. The application can be complex and beautiful, but how would visitors know that upon first glance what the application looks like and what the application is about? Enter, the README file.

A quality README file helps to explain and showcase what the application does, justify the technologies used, and talk about some of the challenges that were faced and features that are hoping to be implemented in the future. A good README helps a developer stands out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all.

With this README generator, one no longer needs to create a professional README from scratch. Simply answer a few questions and watch as a README is created instantly.
